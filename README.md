## Vision Statement 
For this project, we want to understand the differences in performance between C and Golang. While both are statically-typed languages, their design decisions are drastically different. We want to learn to implement common algorithms in Golang and understand the challenges of learning this newer language. We also want to know the rationale behind choosing Golang over an older, heavily tested language like C or vice-versa.
We’re aiming to compare Golang and C by evaluating key performance factors like memory usage, execution speed, and compilation time. One major part of this comparison will be analyzing how Go’s garbage collection impacts performance, especially in contrast to C, which uses manual memory management. We’ll also look at how the languages handle polymorphism and how Golang’s type safety affects runtime efficiency compared to C’s more flexible (but less safe) approach. To really test the strengths and weaknesses, we will run some heavy-duty algorithms like matrix multiplication and deep recursion. Additionally, we’ll create various mini-projects—such as those involving computationally heavy tasks, algorithms that use different data structures, and memory-intensive operations—to better understand how each language handles these challenges and compare their performance across different use cases.
